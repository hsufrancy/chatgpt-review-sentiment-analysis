# chatgpt-review-sentiment-analysis
Overview 

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews of ChatGPT to understand the overall user sentiment and extract meaningful insights. The dataset consists of four columns:
* Review id: Unique identifier for each review
* Review: User-generated review text
* Ratings: Numerical rating (e.g., 1-5)
* Review date: Date when the review was posted

Objectives
Data Exploration & Visualization:
* Analyze distributions of ratings and review lengths.
* Identify trends in sentiment over time using review dates.
* Explore correlations between ratings and sentiment classification.
Sentiment Analysis:
* Use a pre-trained NLP model to classify sentiment.
* Compare sentiment classification with numerical ratings for validation.
Insight Generation:
* Identify common themes or topics in negative and positive reviews using word clouds or topic modeling (e.g., LDA).
* Detect potential biases or patterns in user feedback.

Expected Outcomes
* A structured dataset with sentiment labels for each review.
* Insights on ChatGPTâ€™s reception based on sentiment trends and user ratings.
* Visualizations showcasing review trends, sentiment distribution, and word clouds.
* A written summary of findings, including limitations and future improvements.
